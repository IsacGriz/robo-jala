# Robot Battle Game

Welcome to the Robot Battle Game! This is a text-based game where you control a robot and battle against another player's robot. The game features various robot parts, each with its own attack, defense, and energy consumption attributes.

## How to Play

1. **Robot Creation:**
   - Players take turns creating their robots.
   - Choose a robot name and select a color for your robot.

2. **Robot Parts:**
   - Each robot consists of six parts: Head, Weapon, Left Arm, Right Arm, Left Leg, and Right Leg.
   - Each part has different attack and defense levels, as well as energy consumption.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns attacking each other's robots.
   - Choose a part of your robot to attack with and a part of the opponent's robot to target.
   - Each attack reduces the defense of the targeted part on the opponent's robot.
   - Be strategic in managing your robot's energy and choosing the right parts to attack.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The game continues until one player's robot is no longer functional (energy <= 0) or all parts are broken.
   - The player with the functional robot at the end of the game wins.
